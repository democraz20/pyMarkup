<Fore.YELLOW>=================[pyMarkup]====================
this is the content of the second page
demonstrating navigation mechanics
might change file extensions later
.txt seems a little boring 
as you can see the file name and path
can be anything the user/writer wants 
aslong as that file exists, ofcourse
in the future i might handle requests with 
this as when visiting a web, downloading
all of it's content just to navigate maybe isnt so
