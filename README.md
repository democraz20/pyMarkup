## current syntax 
- "#" for biggest header
- colorama colors, to use 2 add a "," in between. colorama Syntax has to be correct
- "[noEnd]" add at end of line to specify that line printing without creating a new line

## rules 
- incase of using colors in a header, the colors have to come after the # with a space in betweem
- when using multiple colors, cannot have space between the 2 colors (around the ",")
- when using [noEnd], a space is needed infront of the syntax
